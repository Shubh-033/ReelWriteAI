🚀 Ultimate Prompt for Lovable AI
Build me a complete MERN project called ReelWrite AI with the following requirements:

🎯 Project Goal
An AI-powered script generator for content creators where users log in, select content parameters, and receive unique viral scripts with engaging hooks, body, and CTAs.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion

Backend: Node.js + Express

Database: MongoDB Atlas (Free Tier)

Authentication: JWT-based login/signup

AI Integration: Free Hugging Face NLP models (e.g., T5, GPT-J)

Deployment: Local setup (no hosting required yet)

✅ Core Features (MVP)
JWT Authentication (Signup, Login, Logout)

Redirect users to Script Generator Dashboard after login.

Unauthenticated users should not access the generator.

Script Generator

Users enter: Niche, Content Type, Tone & Style, Script Length, and optional notes.

Generate unique AI-powered scripts (Hook, Body, CTA) on each request using Hugging Face.

Include regenerate and copy to clipboard options.

Allow users to save scripts to their account.

UI Design

Keep the same design: white base + bright accent colors (Electric Blue, Neon Pink, Lime Green).

Smooth animations and transitions using Framer Motion.

Use a responsive layout.

Navigation & Buttons

Make all navbar buttons work:

Features → scroll to Features section

Pricing → scroll to Pricing section

About → scroll to About section

Log In → go to Login page

Get Started → go to Signup/Login based on user state

Home page buttons:

Start Creating Scripts → open Script Generator (login required)

Watch Demo → open a placeholder YouTube link

Saved Scripts Dashboard

Users can view, regenerate, copy, and delete saved scripts.

🌟 Extra Enhancements
Ensure each script generation call returns a unique output by adding random variations to the AI prompt.

Add basic error handling and loading indicators for API calls.

Provide clear setup instructions in the README.

🔒 Future Scalability
Keep code modular to add features later (premium plans, analytics, AI voiceovers, etc.).

🧑‍💻 Lovable Task
✅ Build this project with all the above features implemented and working.
✅ Make sure all buttons and links are functional.
✅ Keep the current UI style intact while fixing the broken functionalities.
✅ Connect Hugging Face AI properly so scripts regenerate uniquely.
✅ Include a clean project structure and easy-to-follow setup instructions.
